<h2>Stolen Spaceship</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You have stolen an Unidentified Flying Object and identified it as your new spaceship. The government has sent tanks. Defeat them.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Heart-racing bullethell experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Bullethell, Old Mobile
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The UFO will follow the mouse. Click to shoot.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Revamping the style of play and thus the challenge of the original game.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Blocks
Use BUTTONS to FLY and DESTROY
Tanks!
More Blocks!
</li>

<li><strong>Changes:</strong>
Made the UFO follow the mouse, and made the shooting occur on clicks. There were issues with the following that didn't make any sense, however, so I removed the world scaling, and suddenly it worked. The world however is no bigger than the initial screen. This also partially randomizes the number of enemies in a game, as some will spawn "off screen" and cannot be accessed.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
An unnamed desert in an unnamed country where a non-existant secret facility does not have a powerful alien spacecraft that is not fully operational.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
See Setting/Premise
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Bullethell players looking for a challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
To die? 3-8 seconds. To win? Probably a good 2 minutes on average.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Your "bullets" (they're really photon anti-armor pulsars) carry your velocity. You can use fly-by attack strategies to clear out thick groups.
</li>

<li><strong>Estimated Schedule:</strong>
Depending on how much more detail one would want in the mechanics, anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks more to put together something servicable. More time required for more advanced AI an mobile tanks.
</li>

<li><strong>Team:</strong>
Anthony Sermania: Lead Everything
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Red, Purple, Yellow and Green blocks made with Gimp and assembled in Tiled as necessary (just the green ones really, the rest were used as sprites)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Thomas was alone; inspiration for the art of all future prototypes from me. Seriously, play it. Cool game.
</li>
